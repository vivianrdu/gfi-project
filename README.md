# gfi-project

## Introduction
The purpose of this web application is to promote alternative protein products and innovation. To help consumers discover new alternative protein products, we are developing a machine learning-based recommendation system for alternative protein products and recipes. The current web application is still in its early stages of development. We are currently looking for volunteers familiar with Django and/or database management.
